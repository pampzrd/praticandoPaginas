        <p>
            Just that kiss<br/>
Was all there is<br/>
Every cell in my body<br/>
Lined up for you<br/></p><p>
Legs a little open<br/>
Once again<br/>
Awaken my senses<br/></p><p>
Head topless<br/>
Arisen my senses<br/>
Just that kiss<br/></p><p>
Was all there is<br/>
My palms pulsating of<br/>
The things I want to do to you<br/></p><p>
Just that kiss<br/>
Is all there is<br/>
Weaving a mixtape<br/></p><p>
With every crossfade<br/>
For him a he<br/>
Is WWW<br/>
For him a he<br/>
Is WWW<br/>
Once again<br/></p><p>
Weaving a mixtape<br/>
With every song<br/></p><p>
For who I am<br/>
For, for, with love<br/>
With love<br/>
Awaken my senses<br/></p><p>
Just that kiss<br/>
Once again<br/>
Was all there is<br/></p><p>
Just that kiss<br/>
Once again<br/>
Arisen my senses<br/>
Was all there is<br/></p><p>
Once again<br/>
Just that kiss<br/>
Arisen my senses<br/>
Was all there is<br/>
For him a he<br/></p><p>
Once again I'm made to merge<br/>
With him, for him a he<br/>
I'm made to merge<br/>
With him, for him a he<br/></p>
<p>
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?<br/>
For him a he<br/>
Too keen, too seen, to be seen<br/>
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?<br/></p><p>
Once again I'm made to merge<br/>
With him, by him, he sees me for who<br/> I
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?<br/></p><p>
To be seen or not seen<br/>
With him a he<br/>
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?<br/>
With him a he<br/>

He sees me for who I am<br/>

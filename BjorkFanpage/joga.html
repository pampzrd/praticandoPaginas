            All these accidents that happen<br/>
            Follow the dot<br/>
            Coincidence makes sense<br/>
            Only with you<br/>
            You don't have to speak, I feel<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Emotional landscapes<br/>
            They puzzle me<br/>
            Then the riddle gets solved<br/>
            And you push me up to this<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            State of emergency, how beautiful to be<br/>
            State of emergency, is where I want to be<br/>
        </p><p>
            All that no-one sees<br/>
            You see<br/>
            What's inside of me<br/>
            Every nerve that hurts, you heal<br/>
            Deep inside of me<br/>
            You don't have to speak, I feel<br/>
        </p><p>
            Emotional landscapes<br/>
            They puzzle me, confuse<br/>
            Then the riddle gets solved<br/>
            And you push me up to this<br/>
        </p><p>
            State of emergency, how beautiful to be<br/>
            State of emergency, is where I want to be<br/>

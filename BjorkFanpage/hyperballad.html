        <p>We live on a mountain<br/>
Right at the top<br/>
This beautiful view<br/>
From the top of the mountain<br/></p>
<p>
Every morning I walk towards the edge<br/>
And throw little things off<br/>
Like car parts, bottles and cutlery<br/>
Or whatever I find lying around<br/>
</p>
<p>
It's become a habit, a way to start the day<br/>
</p>
<p>
I go through all this<br/>
Before you wake up<br/>
So I can feel happier<br/>
To be safe up here with you<br/>
I go through all this<br/>
Before you wake up<br/>
So I can feel happier<br/>
To be safe up here with you<br/>
</p>
<p>
It's early morning<br/>
No one is awake<br/>
I'm back at my cliff<br/>
Still throwing things off<br/>
I listen to sounds they make<br/>
On their way down<br/>
I follow with my eyes till they crash<br/>
I Imagine what my body would sound like<br/>
Slamming against those rocks<br/>
</p>
<p>
And when it lands<br/>
Will my eyes be closed or open?<br/>
</p>
<p>
I go through all this<br/>
Before you wake up<br/>
So I can feel happier<br/>
To be safe up here with you<br/>
I go through all this<br/>
Before you wake up<br/>
So I can feel happier<br/>
To be safe up here with you<br/>
I go through all this<br/>
Before you wake up<br/>
So I can feel happier<br/>
To be safe up here with you<br/>
</p>
<p>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
Safe up here with you<br/>
